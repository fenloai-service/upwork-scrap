# Gmail App Password Troubleshooting Guide

## Step 1: Check Your 2-Step Verification Setup

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification
2. Make sure it says "2-Step Verification is ON"
3. Verify you have **SMS or Authenticator App** enabled (NOT just Security Keys)

## Step 2: Access App Passwords

1. Go directly to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. If you see the error, your account type doesn't support app passwords

## Step 3: Check Account Type

- **Personal Gmail** (@gmail.com): Should work after proper 2-step setup
- **Google Workspace** (@company.com): May be restricted by admin
- **Advanced Protection**: App passwords are disabled for security
